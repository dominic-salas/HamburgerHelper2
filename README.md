# HamburgerHelper2
by Dominic Salas and David Rogers

  A rogue-like top-down shooter survival, where the 
  main protagonist, Handy, picks up power ups and defeats 
  fast food moguls to earn money. This currency can be spent on 
  different weapons, as listed below.

Basic Gun -- Free
  This gun, as implied by the name, shoots one bullet as fast as
  the user can click. Each bullet deals a minimal amount of damage,
  with most enemies being dealt with in at least three or more shots.
 
Shotgun -- 5,000 Credits

  The shotgun fires three bullets in a spread-out cone shape, with each 
  single bullet dealing 1 damage, similar to the Basic Gun.
  
Laser Gun -- 12,500 Credits

  The laser gun fires a beam of light, dealing 3 damage. This gun has the
  same fire rate behavior as the Basic Gun.
  
Laser Shotgun -- 25,000 Credits

  Similar to its bullet-firing predecessor, the Laser Shotgun fires three lasers
  in a cone-like shape, disintegrating everything in front of it.
  
Minigun -- 100,000 Credits

  For the efficient hunter, the minigun is a gun that fires as fast as possible,
  with the user having to only hold down the mouse button. Each bullet deals 1
  damage, but with a fire rate faster than the eye can see, nothing stands a chance
  against it.
  
RPG -- 100,000 Credits

  The gentleman's weapon, the Rocket Propelled Grenade is the most efficient weapon
  in the land of Hamburgia. One projectile from this masterpiece kills everything on
  and around it's blast.
  
ElectroGun -- 150,000 Credits
  
  DANGER - GUN MAKES THINGS EVERYTHING GO BOOM. GUN TRACES A PATH TOWARDS ANYWHERE YOU CLICK.
  USE WITH CAUTION.
